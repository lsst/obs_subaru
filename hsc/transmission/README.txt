This folder constains wavelength-dependent (and occasionally spatially-
dependent) transmission curve data for various components of the HSC optical
system.  It is used by the installTransmissionCurves.py script to create
butler-managed datasets that are attached to Exposures during ISR.

M1-2010s.txt: mirror reflectivity as of the 2010 recoating (assumed spatially
constant), downloaded from https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Telescope/Parameter
s/Reflectivity/M1-2010s.txt.

filterTraces.py: spatially-varying traces of the broadband filters, obtained
by private communication from Satoshi Kawanomoto -> Robert Lupton -> Eli
Rykoff.

qe_ccd_HSC.txt: sensor response (assumed spatially constant and common to all
sensors; we believe these assumptions are incorrect at a significant level,
especially in bluer bands, but do not have the data demonstrating this),
downloaded from
https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/txt/qe_ccd_HSC.txt.

throughput_popt2.txt: transmission of the Primary Focus Unit of HSC (assumed
spatially constant), downloaded from
https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/txt/throughput_popt2.txt.

throughput_win.txt: transmission of the HSC dewar window (assumed spatially
constant), downloaded from
https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/txt/throughput_win.txt.

wHSC-*.txt: transmission of narrow-band filters (assumed spatially constant),
downloaded from
https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/sensitivity.html.

modtran_maunakea_am12_pwv15_binned10ang.dat: MODTRAN model for the
atmospheric absorption generated by Naoki Yasuda, assuming airmass 1.2 and
PWV=1.5mm.
